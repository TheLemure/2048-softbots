"""
The softbots. Each one is a function that takes the current board and
returns the direction to move:

    0 = up, 1 = right, 2 = down, 3 = left
    (or use UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT from game_rules)

The board is a list of rows, board[row][col], with 0 for empty cells.
See game_rules.py for helpers to simulate moves on a copy of the board.

Returning None (or anything that isn't 0-3) stops the softbot in the browser.

The server reloads this file on every move, so after saving your changes
just click the button again; there's no need to restart the server.
